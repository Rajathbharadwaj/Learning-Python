Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
Expected Output : 
No. of Upper case characters : 4
No. of Lower case Characters : 33

#CODE
def up_low(s):
    d={"upper":0, "lower":0}
    for c in s:
        if c.isupper():
            d["upper"]+=1
        elif c.islower():
            d["lower"]+=1
        else:
            pass
    print "Original String : ", s
    print "No. of Upper case characters : ", d["upper"]
    print "No. of Lower case Characters : ", d["lower"]
    
    
    #OUTPUT
    
 up_low('Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?')

Original String :  Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?
No. of Upper case characters :  4
No. of Lower case Characters :  33
